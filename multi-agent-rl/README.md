## 1. Predator-Prey with Q-Learning
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning using Q-Learning for predator-prey simulation.

🔥 Why RL?
✅ Reinforcement Learning allows agents to learn from experience instead of relying on pre-coded strategies.
✅ It introduces dynamic, adaptive behavior as agents improve based on feedback.
✅ Multi-Agent RL (MARL) is a hot field in robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.

🏆 New Features to Add:
✅ Q-Learning for decision-making (agents learn from rewards and penalties).
✅ Shared state for cooperative learning among predators.
✅ Exploration vs. Exploitation – Encourage agents to explore the environment early and exploit learned knowledge later.
✅ Custom Reward System – Reward successful capture, penalize collisions.
✅ Training Phase – Run a training loop for agents to learn better strategies over time.
