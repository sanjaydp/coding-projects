## 1. Predator-Prey Simulation
- Simulation of predators trying to catch prey using cooperative strategy.


This code: 
âœ… Implements cooperative predators
âœ… Uses Manhattan distance for pathfinding
âœ… Uses communication between predators
âœ… Real-time updates with matplotlib

ðŸ”Ž Features Added:
âœ… Cooperative behavior for predators
âœ… Prey attempts to evade capture strategically
âœ… Real-time updates and visualization
âœ… Dynamic pathfinding using Manhattan distance
âœ… Event-based termination (capture or survival)

### How to Run
python multi-agent-predator-prey/predator_prey.py
